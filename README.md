# Decentralized Donation Vault

## Overview
This project is a simple decentralized donation smart contract deployed on the Sepolia testnet. 
It allows anyone to donate ETH transparently while only the contract owner can withdraw funds.

## Problem
Traditional donation systems lack transparency and trust.

## Solution
All donations are stored and verified on-chain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

## Features
- Accept ETH donations
- Track total donations
- Owner-only withdrawal
- Fully on-chain logic

## Tech Stack
- Solidity
- Remix IDE
- Sepolia Testnet
- MetaMask
- Etherscan

## Smart Contract
- Network: Sepolia
- Contract Address: `0xYOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
- Etherscan Link: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xYOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS

## How It Works
1. Users call `donate()` and send ETH
2. Donations are stored on-chain
3. Owner can withdraw funds using `withdraw()`
